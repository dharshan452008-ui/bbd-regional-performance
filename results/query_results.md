## Seed check

The seed script `sql/00_schema_and_seed.sql` was executed on SQLite (via Python's built-in `sqlite3` module). The verification checkpoints confirmed the following row counts:

| Table | Expected Count | Verified Row Count | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reps` | 4 | 4 | Verified |
| `products` | 9 | 9 | Verified |
| `customers` | 24 | 24 | Verified |
| `orders` | 90 | 90 | Verified |

All four tables match the expected counts exactly.
